# File Handling Assignment in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts for practicing file handling 

## 1. File Read & Write Challenge

**Script**: `r_w_file.py`

### Description
Reads an input file, modifies its content (converts all text to uppercase), and writes the result to a new file.

## 2. Error Handling

**Script**: `error_h.py`

### Description
Prompts the user for a filename to read and handles potential file-related errors gracefully, such as missing files or unreadable content.
